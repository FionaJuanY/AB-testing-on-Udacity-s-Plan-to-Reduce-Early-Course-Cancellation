# AB-testing-on-Udacity-s-Plan-to-Reduce-Early-Course-Cancellation
# Udacity, an online learning platform, is considering add a feature to its website. This project used A/B testing to help Udacity decide. 
# Three invariant metrics were used to make sure the experiment was not biased, and two evaluation metrics were designed to decide whether the new feature would bring the improvement as expected.
